## Configuration Guide

To get started, simply edit the **Profile** and **Links** sections in `config.js`. Once updated, your setup will be ready to go!

### Link Properties

Each link comes with the following customizable properties:

- **Title** – The visible text on your link's button.  
- **Description** – A short description displayed beneath the title.  
- **Extend** – If this field is filled, the button transforms into an accordion. When expanded, it reveals this content along with the link button.  
- **URL** – The destination visitors are redirected to when clicking the button.  
- **Color** – The button’s color, supporting HEX codes.  
- **Icon** – The icon for your link. Use a Font Awesome class name, which you can find on the [Font Awesome website](https://fontawesome.com).  
- **Index** – Determines the order of the links. Ensure each link has a unique index number to avoid conflicts.  

You may skip any of these fields **except for** the `Index`, which is required for proper sorting.
